When she took the prince\u2019s proffered arm, she could feel his muscles move beneath his silken sleeve. More defined than she\u2019d expect from a pampered royal; an incongruous roughness, like the scar through his eyebrow and the calluses on his hands. Lore and the Sun Prince strolled casually down the clear paths cut into the forest, winding trails carefully designed to look natural while being anything but. A slight breeze fluttered at Bastian\u2019s hair, worn down, waving dark against his shoulders\u2014just on this side of too-long to be in current fashion, though she assumed that however Bastian wore his hair was how the entire court would in a month\u2019s time. He smelled like red wine and expensive cologne, one that Lore\u2019s untrained nose couldn\u2019t pick out the notes of. \u201cI\u2019ve"

This moment feels like a perfect metaphor. \u201cYou keep condoms in your junk drawer?\u201d \u201cAsk that again,\u201d I say, \u201cand realize how funny it sounds.\u201d She snorts behind me, and I feel a wave of protectiveness.

When she was fifteen, she made a milestone list, complete with goals, ages, sometimes even locations: \u2026 Begin Stanford at eighteen, graduate at twenty-two, medical school at Johns Hopkins, residency in San Diego, marriage at thirty, first baby born at thirty-five\u2026 So far she hasn\u2019t missed a single one except for maid of honor at Fizzy\u2019s wedding at twenty-eight.

        "text": "But just before Mrs. Baker can pull the armoire doors open, the record player suddenly skips. The music is replaced by a loud, low groan. It sounds through the entire house, starting at the first floor and moving upward, gaining volume as it goes. I know what it is. Mrs. Baker does, too, for her face darkens with concern. The groan is followed by a crack, a clatter, and several sudden, sharp jerks. It sounds like something\u2019s smashing into the house. Inside the armoire, I\u2019m jostled like a body in a coffin that\u2019s just been dropped. One of the doors flies open, exposing me being knocked back and forth behind Mrs. Baker\u2019s long black dresses. But she\u2019s no longer there to see me. Instead, she\u2019s throwing open the bedroom door and peering into the hall, one withered hand gripping the wall for support as all of Hope\u2019s End bucks and heaves. As quickly as it started,"
