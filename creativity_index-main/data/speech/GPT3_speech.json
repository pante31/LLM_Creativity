These words, spoken by General Douglas MacArthur, hold a powerful truth that resonates with every member of our armed forces. As we gather here today, let us take a moment to reflect on the true meaning of sacrifice and the role it plays in the lives of our brave soldiers.\n\nSacrifice is a word that carries a heavy weight. It is not simply a noble act or a selfless gesture, but a way of life for those who serve in the military. It requires the relinquishment of personal comfort, safety, and even one's own life for the greater good. It is the ultimate act of devotion and dedication to a cause greater than oneself.\n\nFor our soldiers,",
