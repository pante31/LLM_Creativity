She couldn't explain it, nor did she care to try and figure it out.  All she knew was that her heart felt lighter, almost as if a heavy burden had been lifted off of her shoulders.  As if a switch had been flipped and all of the feelings that she had been suppressing for so long had finally found their way out of her and into the open.\n\nIt had all started with a simple conversation.  A conversation that she had been avoiding for far too long.  A conversation that she had been dreading, but at the same time, she couldn't resist the urge to have.
